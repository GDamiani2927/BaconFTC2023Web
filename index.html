        <h1>About Robotics</h1>
        <p>
            Robotics is the interdisciplinary field that deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. Robots are machines that can be programmed to carry out a series of complex actions automatically, usually with the goal of performing tasks that are difficult, dangerous, or repetitive for humans.

            Robotics combines various branches of engineering and science, such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence. It involves designing robots that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and interact with the physical world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Robotics has a wide range of applications, including industrial automation, healthcare, exploration of space and underwater environments, entertainment, and education. As technology advances, robots are becoming more sophisticated and capable of performing tasks that were once thought to be exclusively human.
